## Description
LangChat helps users improve their language skills by connecting them with other users that they can practice with. Users will list the languages they speak fluently and the languages they want to practice and they can filter other users by language to find practice partners.

## Features
* Join realtime one on one chats with other users to practice language skills
* View all other users including a bio, profile picture, the languages they speak or are learning and their approximate skill level 
* Filter other users by language to find partners that match the user's learning preferences
* Add another user as a partner to easily connect to the people they chat with the most
* Set status as active or away to let users know if you're available to chat
* Option to sign up and login using Google account, Facebook Account, or email/password
